# Hello hackers

## Intro to Commands

This is basically about us writng our first command.

### Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8FMPJ6Hcb2_FxNDs5Eii5d5oGUI.QX3YjM1wCNwAzNzEzW}`

The command whoami checks who is the user. Then the hello command gives us the flag.

```bash

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami

hacker

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello

Success! Here is your flag:

pwn.college{8FMPJ6Hcb2_FxNDs5Eii5d5oGUI.QX3YjM1wCNwAzNzEzW}

```

### New learnings

This helps us to simply get the flag behind a preset command which is hello in this case.

## Intro to Arguments

This will teach us about using arguments.

### Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{057NJYFizDddcCFLRoJZiCGsHF9.QX4YjM1wCNwAzNzEzW}`

The echo command repeated the argument after it. To get the flag we had to simply write the command hello followed by hackers argument.    

```bash

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$  echo Hello Hackers!

Hello Hackers!

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello hackers

Success! Here is your flag:

pwn.college{057NJYFizDddcCFLRoJZiCGsHF9.QX4YjM1wCNwAzNzEzW}

```
