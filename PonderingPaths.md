# Pondering Paths

## The Root

Invoking a program using by providing its path using "/"

### Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ImYc3BUkssFR9jVY0I3JBbuEU0Z.QX4cTO0wCNwAzNzEzW}`

Using / allows me to access different paths for different programs. In this case we will be using /pwn to directly access the pwn program and run it.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ImYc3BUkssFR9jVY0I3JBbuEU0Z.QX4cTO0wCNwAzNzEzW}
```

### New learnings 

This challenge helped me to learn how to access different programs under / and also taught me how to directly access a program.
